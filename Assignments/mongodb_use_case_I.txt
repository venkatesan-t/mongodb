a) list the business requirements
needs scalability - horizontal scalability - by adding servers we should be able to support more users/load on the server
need to support structured, semi structured and unstructured data
database should support agile methodology - should be schema-less, dynamic
need good performance even when the load on the database increases

b) compare different database categories
should be schema-less, as the database required should support semi structured and unstructured data. also, schema design and updating schema/database for requirements takes time.
Hence, RDBMS, ORDBMS, ODBMS and Columnar databases are ruled out.
key-value and document types databases are good fit for this requirement

c) Select a database from category which caters to the business needs
key-value or document database suits the need. However, the document based database provides more flexibility. Key-value databases are too simple for storing application data.
Mongodb is a popular document database and it is schema-less and has horizontal scalability. Hence, we can choose mongodb for out database.

d) Install the database
Installed MongoDB community edition as Windows Network Service
Also, installed NoSqlClient and configured the same to connect to the installed MongoDB

e) Explore the database
listed the databases in the mongodb instance
Used the find command to list all the documents in collection
